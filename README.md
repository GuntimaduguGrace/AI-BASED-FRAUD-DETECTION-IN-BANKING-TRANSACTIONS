#AI-BASED FRAUD DETECTION IN BANKING TRANSACTIONS:ENHANCING SECURITY AND EFFICIENCY BY USING ML AND PREDICTIVE ANALYTIC TECHNIQUES
## Project Description
This project detects fraudulent banking transactions using Machine Learning and Predictive Analytics. 
It enhances security and efficiency by identifying potentially fraudulent activities in real-time.
Users can upload their dataset, visualize transaction patterns, and compare multiple ML models for fraud detection.
## Dataset
- Dataset used: `online_fraud_detection.csv`
- Contains features like transaction type, amount, and fraud labels.
- Users can upload their own CSV to test the models in the app.
